* KeSi

Yet another attempt at porting KeSi to JavaScript and possibly simplifying it.

** Goals

Conversion between traditional POJ and Ministry of Education's spelling reform (TL or “KIP”).

** Thanks

This is / will be a port of [[https://github.com/i3thuan5/KeSi][i3thuan5/KeSi]].

** Progress [26%]
